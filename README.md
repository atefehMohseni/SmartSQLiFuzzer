# SmartSQLiFuzzer
Version 0.9


SmartSQLiFuzzer contains two primary applications:

'sqli' which generates mutated SQLi queries to a web server by using Genetic Algorithm and

'testwebapp' which is a simplified WAF (Web Application Firewall) protecting the victim web server from SQLi attacks.


You might run the program with more than two generations in genetic AL. to circumvent the WAF SQLi detection mechanism.

Installation guide :
run .exe files existed in Debug folder in each app(the details of installation will be added ASAP)

Note: In this version, the SQLi attack will be targeted the HTTP headers only.
